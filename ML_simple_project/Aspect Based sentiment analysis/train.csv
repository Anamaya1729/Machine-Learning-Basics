Bases can't link to one another. This restriction really holds back possibilities, like, say, a single CRM base (with customers, tasks, etc.) that's SHARED by any/all other bases

No offline support whatsoever. Cannot even VIEW without a connection. Bummer.

It's tedious (and/or privacy-invading) to add pics/attachments. I don't want to share my entire iCloud photo library. I DO want to simply copy/paste into attachment fields!

Share menu? Also would be handy to add images, or anything, from other apps to bases via iOS share menu

Collapsible editable groupings of fields (in form view and/or table view) would be FANTASTIC to reduce scrolling and organize

It’s all there in AirTable. AirTable is an incredibly powerful tool. I also use it to inventory my personal music collection. Love it! 

FEATURE REQUEST: Please add support for Gallery view on iOS and iPadOS. A number of the projects on which I work include the approval of images for use in various projects. Gallery view is a must for these types of projects, so I can easily view the images. I currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. I would much rather use AirTable for everything. Plus, if Gallery view was enabled on iOS and iPadOS, I would undoubtedly upload more images to AirTable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which I would be happily do, by the way 😉

"I discovered Airtable last week and after testing it out, I LOVE it. It’s easily customisable and replaces my reliance on a spreadsheet to maintain my inventory. The only issue is that the app is so limited. I can’t duplicate a record which is frustrating when I purchase 20 different things from the same supplier on the same date etc. This means I have to either duplicate the record on a desktop (in which case, why use the app) or I have to manually enter the same information 20 times. This is incredibly frustrating.

Another gripe I have is that I can’t customise the first column in the base or freeze the first two columns. A picture is very important for my inventory and I need to either customise the first column to allow addition of a picture as or freeze the first two columns so that when i scroll across, I can relate the information to the exact item. Freezing columns is available on the desktop version but not the app which means that when I’m out and about, I have to constantly scroll back and forth.

There are other limitations in the app such as the inability to select multiple records to delete/copy or the lack of gallery/calendar/kanban view, but those aren’t as exasperating for me as the previous two I mentioned. It’s a shame because desktop version of Airtable is an incredible tool and so versatile while the iOS app is so restricted. If we were talking about the desktop version I’d give it 5 stars but for now, the iOS app only gets 3.",Freezing,1

Also, it doesn't seem to be specifically built into the app, but there seems to be a way to do offline, as long as the base you want to view is left open before you go offline and viewing is all you need.

Suggestions:
- Ability to change checkbox status without having to open the specific record.

- The ability to export certain records. Let's say you have an active filter and you want to export just the ones you're viewing.

- Form view for mobile.",Form view,1

"Airtable is an amazing app. My company is currently starting to implement this for product tracking and it is almost the perfect tool. I’ve rated the app 3 stars for 2 reasons:

No gallery view in app
-the ability to switch between views is the main reason we use Airtable instead of excel. Having an app version (that has a zoom option) would make this a 4 star app. 

No offline viewing mode
- the collaborative nature of this program is amazing. I realize solving discrepancies is the main reason for not having an offline mode. However, We use this mainly for a visual representation of our products. If we are in a building with bad signal or traveling overseas, it would be ideal to at least have a “last saved version” to reference photos offline. Offline viewing mode would make this a 5 star app.

I will immediately revise this review if gallery view is added to the app and if an offline viewing mode is added.

"Don’t get me wrong, Airtable is a great platform, but promising everything is misleading. Everything requires numerous bolt on integrations that cost our company an extra $175/month. 

The Zapier integration helps a ton. However it’s missing several vital triggers. Like detecting an updated record. Thus the workaround is a $49/per month patch “plug in” by a 3rd party. 

Zapier claims they have been requesting this of Airtable to enable this for many many months. 

Come on Airtable. Please don’t make us pay hundreds of dollars more per month to enable features that Airtable could certainly provide. 

Another missing function (which would not require a zap), allowing customers to update their own record requires a 3rd party integration to simply create a unique url to a unique form for external updating. Airtable developers could flip a switch to get these “BASICS” enabled.",Zapier,1
