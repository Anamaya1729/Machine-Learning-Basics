# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem statement
To train a model that predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning".

## Structure of the dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle.
The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. The 19 input features and 1 target variable are:

1. "state", string. 2-letter code of the US state of customer residence
2. "account_length", numerical. Number of months the customer has been with the current telco provider
3. "area_code", string="area_code_AAA" where AAA = 3 digit area code.
4. "international_plan", (yes/no). The customer has international plan.
5. "voice_mail_plan", (yes/no). The customer has voice mail plan.
6. "number_vmail_messages", numerical. Number of voice-mail messages.
7. "total_day_minutes", numerical. Total minutes of day calls.
8. "total_day_calls", numerical. Total minutes of day calls.
9. "total_day_charge", numerical. Total charge of day calls.
